Installing The Orrery
---------------------

[ Note: if you're interested in installing the Orrery on Linux from
  an RPM, you can ignore this file.  Just install the RPM (after
  installing the Geomview RPM itself, of course), and next time
  you run Geomview, you'll see "Orrery" listed in the list of modules ]

Quick summary
-------------

    0. Make sure you have configured, built, and installed
       version 1.8.0 or higher of Geomview.

    1. Let GEOMROOT stand for the top level of your Geomview
       source tree.

	% cd GEOMROOT/src/bin
	% tar xvfz orrery-0.9.2.tar.gz

    2.  % cd GEOMROOT
	% ./configure

    3.  % cd GEOMROOT/src/bin/orrery-0.9.2
	% make install

    0. For the rest of this discussion, let GEOMROOT stand for the
       path of the top level directory of your Geomview source tree.
       Make sure you have at least version 1.8.0 of Geomview.

       These instructions assume that you have already configured,
       built, and installed Geomview on your system.  You can,
       however, configure and build both Geomview and the Orrery at the
       same time if you want.  See the note on "Simultaneous
       Configuring/Building" below for details on this.

    1. Unpack the Orrery distribution into the "src/bin"
       subdirectory of your Geomview source tree.  Once you've done
       this, you should have a directory named something like
       GEOMROOT/src/bin/orrery-0.9.2, where 0.9.2 is replaced
       with whatever version of the Orrery you have.

    2. Re-run Geomview's top-level 'configure' script:

	  % cd GEOMROOT
	  % ./configure [OPTIONS]

       Give it the same options, if any, that you used when you last
       ran it.  (If you're not sure what options you used, you can
       find out by looking in GEOMROOT/config.status).

       The point of this step is to make sure that GEOMROOT/configure
       gets run after the Orrery has been unpacked into
       GEOMROOT/src/bin.

    3. If you're compiling/installing Geomview and the Orrery
       at the same time, run "make install" in the GEOMROOT
       directory.  If you have previously installed Geomview,
       you can run "make install" in just the Orrery directory:

            % cd GEOMROOT/src/bin/orrery-0.9.2
	    % make install

       If you don't want to "install", you can just run "make",
       which will allow you to run the Orrery from the Geomview
       build tree.  (Invoke "./geomview" from GEOMROOT and select
       "Orrery" from the list of "External Modules".

       Note that the Orrery consists of a Tcl/Tk script, so
       there is nothing to compile.  Typing "make" creates a symbolic
       link in GEOMROOT/data which allows the Orrery to run from
       the build tree, and "make install" copies all the Orrery
       files into the Geomview installation directory (usually
       /usr/local/Geomview).


Simultaneous Configuring/Building
---------------------------------

If you have just downloaded Geomview and the Orrery (and/or any other
Geomview module packages), you can configure, build, and install
everything in one fell swoop as follows:

  a. unpack the Geomview source tree; let GEOMROOT stand for the path
     of the top-level of this source tree (e.g. "geomview-1.8.0").
  b. unpack whatever module packages you have into the
     "GEOMROOT/src/bin" subdirectory
  c. cd into the GEOMROOT directory and run 'configure', giving it
     whatever options are appropriate for your system
  d. type "make install" (from the GEOMROOT directory)

See GEOMROOT/INSTALL.Geomview for details what options to pass to
'configure'.
