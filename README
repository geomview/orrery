  [ the same as the original one that Stuart Levy released in 1997.   ]
  [ The only difference is in the organization of the files --- this  ]

The Orrery is a digital model of the solar system, named for the mechanical
models of the same name (often you'll see one with just the Sun, Earth
and Moon, as little balls supported on wires); the first such was built
for the fourth Earl of Orrery in the 1700's.

It includes all nine planets, some of their satellites, and a few recent
comets.

If you have questions, problems, or comments relating to this software
(which probably deserves to be called a beta release), please write to us at:

INSTALLATION

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

The .geomview-orrery file(s) mention "wish", the tcl/tk interpreter;
they assume it's on your UNIX search path.  You may want to change
this for a couple of reasons:

  - if you have a version 8.0 wish installed somewhere,
	and it's different from "wish", use that.  The pre-interpretation
	in tcl/tk 8.0 speeds up the orrery's calculations quite a bit.
  - if you don't have "wish" installed, but you do have one of the
	geomview 1.6.1 releases, you can use its built-in wish.
	Change "wish" to "emodule-wish.sh".

  In either case, you can just edit any of the
    modules/*/.geomview-orrery
  files; they're all linked together, so changing any of them changes all.

WHAT'S INCLUDED?

  You can invoke the orrery itself with

    geomview -start orrery

  or by picking "Orrery" from geomview's list of modules.
  See the "Help" button for explanations and suggestions on use.

  You'll also find some command-line-based tools in src/bin/orrery.
  Invoked with no parameters, each gives a brief usage message describing
  how to use it.

    peri2elem
	Add new comets.  Convert cometary orbital elements,
	with specified eccentricity, perihelion distance and date,
	into something which could be added to our orbital-elements file,
	data/modules/orrery/orrery.elements.

    stargv
	Make your own star field.  Read yale.star-format file,
	extracting stars brighter than a specified limit, and writing
	Geomview-readable file suitable to be placed in
	data/modules/orrery/stars-to-mag-N.oogl.
	If you have the SAO database in ".star"-format too (not included here),
	you can generate star charts down to mag 9 or so.

    mktxmesh
	Generate a spherical MESH object, with texture coordinates specified
	for one of several kinds of map projections.

  Also, there's some reusable tcl code in the data/modules/orrery
  directory:

    data/modules/orrery/vectext.tcl
	Vector text generator.  Contains a built-in Hershey font.

    data/modules/orrery/browser.tcl
	A simple file browser.



DEPENDENCIES

You'll need at least some variant of geomview 1.6, as some of
the bodies include texture maps, which geomview 1.5 couldn't parse.
Even in geomview 1.6.1, the plain-X renderer accepts but ignores texture
mapping.  Most of the geomview 1.6.1 binary distributions also include an
Open GL version, built using the Open-GL-like Mesa libraries.
You can see textured images with
  geomview -opengl -start orrery

Note that texture mapping is still off by default; see the Display... panel.


LIMITATIONS

The Orrery is very simple numerically; it just uses fixed Keplerian
orbital elements for each body.  Though there's no closed form for
position as a function of time on such an orbit, there *is* a closed form
for time as a function of position; it uses Newton's method to find the
inverse function for each body at each time step.
The orbital elements are, I suspect, osculating elements as of 1996.0,
though I'm not sure; they're expressed in epoch-2000 coordinates.
The only exception to this is the moon; see Credits below.

Accuracy seems moderately good; within a few years of the present,
positions (RA, Dec) among the inner planets seem within a minute of arc
or so of values from Elwood Downey's "ephem" program.
Cometary positions seem similarly accurate.  The outer planets (>= Jupiter)
are much worse -- off by several minutes of arc.  I don't know why.
Lunar positions are good enough to detect eclipses, but not to predict them;
the moon's longitude often seems to be off by an hour or two of lunar motion.

Accuracy gets much worse at times far from the present; positions centuries
from now disagree with "ephem" by a few degrees.


CREDITS

This Orrery module was written, originally as a demonstration of Geomview
texture mapping, by Stuart Levy (slevy@ncsa.uiuc.edu) at the Geometry Center,
University of Minnesota and is copyright (c) 1997, University of Minnesota.
Non-commercial use and redistribution are permitted so long as this notice
remains.

The formulae for calculating the Moon's position were adapted from Elwood
Downey's "ephem" program, <URL:ftp://iraf.noao.edu/contrib/xephem/ephem>;
he in turn translated them from Peter Duffet-Smith's book "Astronomy with
Your Personal Computer", Cambridge University Press, 1985.
I've omitted many small-amplitude terms, so this lunar ephemeris is less
accurate than theirs.

For all other bodies, planetary orbital elements and physical data
(pole direction, etc.) in data/modules/orrery/orrery.elements
were taken from JPL's program "quick"; I think they amount to osculating
elements as of 1996.0, in coordinate system 2000.0.  Orbital elements
are widely available, though I'm not sure where you can find physical
data in a convenient, publicly available place; maybe the US Govt.
Printing Office publication Astronomical Almanac?  (Some comets were added
by hand.  Note that the Orrery module deals only with elliptical orbits, e<1.)

The stars were taken from the Yale Bright Star Catalogue.  The version
used was the "yale.star" reduced file included as part of the
useful "starchart" package:
  <URL:ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/comp.sources.unix/volume12/starcharts/>
  <URL:ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/comp.sources.unix/volume13/starchart/>
That file is also included here, as src/bin/orrery/yale.tar.gz.



Most of the images included here in the data/modules/orrery directory,
used for texturing the surfaces of the planets, are copyrighted,
but may be used under fairly liberal conditions, naturally including proper
credit to their sources.  So, here are the credits for these fine images,
with the place from which each was retrieved.

The images weren't retrieved in precisely the form given here; often they
were JPEG or sometimes GIF images of some arbitrary size, which I've
scaled and converted into these power-of-two-sized .ppm.{Z,gz} files.

The images came from three sources:
 - NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS, <URL:http://www-pdsimage.wr.usgs.gov>)
 - the Clementine Lunar Image Browser (image of Earth's Moon);
 - the Geometry Center using public-domain CIA outline data for the Earth.

 * earth.ppm.Z
    I (slevy@ncsa.uiuc.edu) produced this Earth image using the public-domain
    CIA World Bank II outline database, with a program derived from one
    written by Joe Dellinger of Stanford.  The adapted program, with data,
    is available from <URL:ftp://geom.umn.edu/priv/slevy/worldmap.tar.gz>.
    Basically it wrote a collection of Postscript outlines for a
    rectangular projection of the earth; these were converted to an image,
    then manually patched up and flood-filled using ImageMagick.

Here's the copyright statement for the PDS images, as obtained from
<URL:http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/archive/copyright.html>, 10/31/1996.
