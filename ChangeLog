	* release 0.9.3

	* modified settings in configure script and Makefile to allow this
	  distribution to be configured and built outside of the Geomview
	  source tree.  (This was actually pretty easy, since there isn't
	  anything to compile.)

2001-03-18  Mark Phillips  <mbp@geomtech.com>

	* created version of Orrery that uses Geomview's GNU autoconf
	  and Makefile system and which is "insertable" into
	  an existing geomview 1.8.0 (or higher) source tree.  See
	  INSTALL for installation details.
	
        * release 0.9.2
